## Introduction

The source / content system is responsible for frontend management.
Elements are developed in the sub-languages TypeScript and SASS and compiled in the content folder.
When deploying, only the content folder is adopted.

`Source Folder:`
![src][src]

`Content Folder:`
![content][content]
