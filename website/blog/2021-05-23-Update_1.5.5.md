## 1.5.5

### Updates & More

Hi everyone, I have reactivated this project and with the 1.5.5 update I have made a security patch available. On the one hand, this contains updates of the supplied packages, on the other hand, it also introduces GUIDs natively for user accounts. I can't say when the next content update will be available, but I'll try to keep delivering security updates in a timely manner. Have fun and keep coding ^^
